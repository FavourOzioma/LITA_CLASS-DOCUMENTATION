In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting
   
### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
---
EDA involves the exploring of data to answer some questions about the
data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which product are top sellers
- What are the products on the peak sales.
### DATA ANALYSIS

This is where we include some basic lines of code or query or even some of the DAX
expressions used during your analysis;


```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
